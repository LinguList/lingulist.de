CLICS â€” Database of Cross-Linguistic Colexifications
=====================================================

* CLICS is a database of automatically extracted, cross-linguistically occurring cases of colexification ("polysemies" in a broad sense).
* The official version of CLICS has now been officially launched. You can find the database at http://clics.lingpy.org.
* For the database, form-meaning pairs taken from three different sources were combined, yielding a total of more than 1000 concepts translated into more than 200 languages covering more than 40 language families.
* For details on the data and examples on what can be done with it, please check out the paper by [List, Terhalle, and Urban (2013)](http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/W/W13/W13-0208.pdf).
* For a preliminary version of the data underlying CLICS, check out the supplementary material accompanying the paper.
* If you want to check how far we are from the first official release, you can check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LinguList/clics).
