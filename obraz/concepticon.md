Concepticon: A Resource for the Linking of Concept Lists
========================================================

* The Concepticon (common work with Michael Cysouw and Robert Forkel) is a resource that links more than 50 different concept lists (often also called "Swadesh lists") which have been proposed in the literature.
* With help of this resource, one can, among others, easily compare which authors would qualify which concepts as belonging to the realm of basic vocabulary, and which not. 
* If you want to check the raw data underlying the application, you can download it from our [Github Repository](http://github.com/clld/concepticon-data).
* Visit the official website at [http://clld.concepticon.org](http://clld.concepticon.org) for more information.
