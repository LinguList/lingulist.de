title: FAZ Article Online and Blog Post on the Systemic Aspects of Sound Change 
type: news
---

I am pleased to announce that the [FAZ](https://faz.net) article I
mentioned in a [previous post](http://lingulist.de/2018/03/16/faz.html) has now
appeared online, where you can freely read it: [Wie erforscht man
Urspr√ºnge?](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/forschung-und-lehre/wie-erforscht-man-urspruenge-streit-der-indogermanistik-15490879.html).

Furthermore, my English blogpost for March just appeared. This time, I try to explain why
sound change is so peculiar, and why it cannot be simplified with changes in
DNA or protein sequences due to mutations: [It's the system,
stupid!](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.de/2018/03/its-system-stupid-more-thoughts-on.html).
