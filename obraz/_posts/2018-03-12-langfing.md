title: New German Blog Post on the Imitation of Unknown Languages 
type: news
---

During the weekend, I found time to write my monthly German blog post. This time, I discuss 
how speakers of a given language imitate or joke about speakers from other languages. This topic is linguistically interesting, since it may reveal quite a few things about the speakers who joke about foreign languages, 
as I try to show with German jokes about the Chinese language. The post can be found [here](https://wub.hypotheses.org/227).
