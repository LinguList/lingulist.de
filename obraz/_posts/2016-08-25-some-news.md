Two papers in which I was involved have come out since I found time to update
my website the last time. One on the automatic detection of partial cognates
presented at the ACL 2016 conference in Berlin (common work with Philippe Lopez
and Eric Bapteste, [PDF
here](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-2097.pdf)), and one on analogies
between biology and linguistics, published in Biology direct (common work with
Jananan Sylvestre Pathmanathan, Philippe Lopez, and Eric Bapteste, [PDF
here](http://biologydirect.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13062-016-0145-2)).
While the first paper is rather technical and presents a new method that nicely
handles partial cognates in multilingual wordlists (with all possible
limitations of course), the latter is a review or opinion paper in which we try
to identify new and fruitful analogies between evolutionary processes in
biological and linguistic evolution. I also announced this paper in a new
blogpost titled [More on analogies between biological and linguistic
evolution](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.fr/2016/08/more-on-analogies-between-biological.html),
and I hope that this may eventually lead to some larger fruitful discussion
about analogies and methodological transfer between scientific disciplines.
