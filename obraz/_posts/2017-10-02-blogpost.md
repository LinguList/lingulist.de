title: New German Blogpost for September 
type: news
---

On a last-minute-note I managed to write my monthly German blogpost for September, which was published last Saturday and deals with freedom and obligation in languages: [Wahlpflicht und Wahlfreiheit in der Sprache](http://wub.hypotheses.org/139). In this post, I discuss how language offers us freedom of choice while at the same time forcing us to follow certain rules and norms when expressing our thoughts.
