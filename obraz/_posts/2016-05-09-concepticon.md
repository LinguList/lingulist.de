title: CLLD Concepticon 1.0 Released 
type: news
---

Today, we released the CLLD Concepticon in version 1.0.  This resource links
concept labels from different conceptlists to concept sets. Each concept set is
given a unique identifier, a unique label, and a human-readable definition.
Concept sets are further structured by defining different relations between the
concepts. The resource
can be used for various purposes. Serving as a rich reference for new and
existing databases in diachronic and synchronic linguistics, it allows
researchers a quick access to studies on semantic change, cross-linguistic
polysemies, and semantic associations.
