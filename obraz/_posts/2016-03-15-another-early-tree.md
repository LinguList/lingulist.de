title: Blogpost on another early tree of languages 
type: news
---

More by chance than by active search I found an interesting paper on morphology ([Zeige 2015](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Zeige2015)) in which an early language tree by Justus Georg Schottel (1612-1676) was mentioned that I was not aware of before.
I discuss the paper and the language tree in more detail in a blogpost I wrote for David Morrison's blog [The Genealogical World of
Phylogenetic Networks](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.fr/) and which you may
find
[here](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.fr/2016/03/another-early-tree-in-linguistics.html).
