Our research project on [computer-assisted language comparison](http://calc.digling.org) offers three positions for three years each, two for doctoral students, and one for a post-doc (the post-doc position is initially for two years with an option for a one-year extension after positive evaluation after the first year). Starting date is April 2018, and deadline for the submission of applications is end of January. The call for post-docs with all details, can be found [here](http://calc.digling.org/resources/job-postdoc2-calc_english.pdf) and the call for doctoral studens can be found [here](http://calc.digling.org/resources/job-doc-calc_english.pdf). 

During the last days, I managed to finish two new blogpost. The first is a follow-up from our earlier blogpost on animal names, this time devoted to [goats and sheep](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.de/2017/11/man-gave-names-to-all-those-animals.html). The second blogpost (in German) is devoted to "hybrid pronunciations", exemplified with help of the debate about the [Jamaica coalition](http://wub.hypotheses.org/160) in Germany.

I would also like to announce that our upcoming workshop on "Old Chinese and Friends" is gaining more structure (to take place from 26-27 of April, 2018, in Jena), and we have just managed to launch the [project website](http://calc.digling.org/events/ocaf.html) along with the [call for abstracts](http://calc.digling.org/events/abstracts/ocaf-call.pdf) online.
