title: Blogpost on Analogy between Biology and Linguistics 
type: news
---

Recently, a lot of analogies have been drawn between evolutionary biology and historical linguistics. Not all of them are useful, but also those which are potentially useful can be exaggerated, and we can end up seing similarities which are in fact not there.    

I discuss this question in more detail in a blogpost I just wrote for David Morrison's blog on ["The Genealogical World of Phylogenetic Networks](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.de), and which you may find [here](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.fr/2015/07/productive-and-unproductive-analogies.html).
