title: Blogpost on Data Sharing 
type: news

In 2013, [Nature](http://www.nature.com/news/announcement-reducing-our-irreproducibility-1.12852) launched a discussion on how to increase the reproducability of research in the biomedical sciences. In my opinion, this topic does not only concern the sciences, but also, and even specifically, the humanities. In times where more and more data for anthropological research is being produced, and the formerly manually conducted analyses are being automated, we need to increase the awareness of scholars and publishers that publishing only the results is not enough to meet rigorous scientific standards. In contrast to the situation a couple of years ago, data sharing has now become much easier. I give an overview on the new possibilities of data sharing in a new blogpost I just wrote for David Morrison's blog on ["The Genealogical World of Phylogenetic Networks](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.de), and which you may find [here](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.de/2015/09/sharing-supplementary-data-linguists.html).
