title: May update for April 
type: news
---

I was a bit quiet during April and not announcing both the two blog posts I wrote, a German post on [systemic evolution](https://wub.hypotheses.org/239), and an English post on [classical approaches to borrowing detection](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.de/2018/04/stratification-how-linguists.html) in historical linguistics. This is mostly due to the fact that we were all very busy in April, as our [CALC project](http://calc.digling.org) organized its first conference, a workshop on [Old Chinese and Friend](http://calc.digling.org/events/ocaf.html), which went rather well, with many fruitful discussions. Although May will also be a busy month, I hope to be able to provide updates earlier in this news feed.
