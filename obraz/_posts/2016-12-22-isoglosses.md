title: Blogpost on Isogloss Maps and Hypergraphs 
type: news
---

Isogloss maps are a popular format for data-display in analyses in historical linguistics and dialectology. Only recently, when reading [Newman's book on networks](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Newman2010), I realized that isogloss maps are essentially hypergraphs and that hypergraphs are essentially bipartite networks. What this means is discussed in some detail in 
a recent blog post I
wrote for David Morrison's blog [The Genealogical World of Phylogenetic
Networks](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.fr), which you can find
[here](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.fr/2016/12/isogloss-maps-are-hypergraphs-are.html).
