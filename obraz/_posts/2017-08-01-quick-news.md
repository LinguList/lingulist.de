Having been traveling for about two weeks, interrupted by a talk I gave in Cologne, I am now back at work and finally find time to announce some news on what happened recently. First, there are two new blogposts I wrote, one in English on [similarities in linguistics](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.de/2017/07/more-on-similarities-in-linguistics.html), a follow-up to a blogpost I devoted to the same topic [earlier this year](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.de/2017/01/similarities-and-language-relationship.html). The other blogpost in German is devoted to [impoliteness (Unh√∂flichkeit)](http://wub.hypotheses.org/117) in Chinese and other languages. Second, there is the talk I gave together with Nathan W. Hill in Cologne, on a workshop on the regularity of sound change, organized by Eugen Hill and Robert Mailhammer. In our talk, titled ["Computer-assisted approaches to linguistic reconstruction"](https://speakerdeck.com/lingulist/computer-assisted-approaches-to-linguistic-reconstruction) , we outlined a new framework for automated linguistic reconstruction which we illustrated with examples from the Burmish languages.
