title: New Post on Gender Differences in Language  
type: news
---

Last week, I wrote my monthly German post, titled [Huhu, Digga! Geschlechtsunterschiede in der Sprache](https://wub.hypotheses.org/269). I discuss recent phenomena of gender differences in the German language and their potential implications for the debate in German about "fair language" ("gerechte Sprache").
