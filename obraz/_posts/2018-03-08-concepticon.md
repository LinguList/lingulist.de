title: Finally Released Concepticon 1.1 and New Drafts
type: news
---

After two years of hard work on API and data, we have finally managed to release version 1.1 of the [Concepticon resource](http://concepticon.clld.org).  In addition to the general application, we also offer a standalone app with enhanced search functionalities in currently seven languages, which can be found [here](http://calc.digling.org/concepticon/). 

Furthermore, we just submitted our final version (before the final proofs) of an paper that will appear some time later in 2018 with the provocative title [Save the trees: Why we need tree models in historical linguistics (and when we should apply them)](http://lingulist.de/documents/papers/jacques-list-2018-save-the-trees-draft.pdf). 

Last not least, a short paper on the question *Are automatic methods for cognate detection good enough for phylogenetic reconstruction* (Taraka Rama, myself, Johannes Wahle, and Gerhard JÃ¤ger) was now accepted as a short paper to be presented in form of a poster at the NAACL conference. We're currently revising the draft, but we will try to put a draft close to the final version soon. The results indicate that especially the simpler methods may perform surprisingly well, although we could, unfortunately, only check the topology.
