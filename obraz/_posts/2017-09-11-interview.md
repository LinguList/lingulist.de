type: news
---

Last week, I gave a radio interview with [Deutschlandfunk Nova](http://www.deutschlandfunknova.de) in which I tried my best to answer questions regarding language diversity and its driving forces. The interview, held in German, was broadcasted yesterday, and can also be found online [under this link](https://www.deutschlandfunknova.de/beitrag/linguistik-warum-wir-viele-sprachen-sprechen).
