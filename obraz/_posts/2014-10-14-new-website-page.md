title: New Website Schema and Design 
type: news
---

I am testing a new way to create my website, using [Obraz](http://obraz.pirx.ru), a static site generator similar to [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), but written in pure Python.

So far, I am very content with the possibilities offered by Obraz, and I think this new schema will save me a lot of time in the future, especially when writing news posts.
 
There are still several things I have to work on, especially the layout for handheld devices which still follows the old design, but I hope to adapt everything quickly in the near future.

For those interested in checking the Obraz and Python code underlying this site, the source code is available at [http://github.com/lingulist/lingulist.de](http://github.com/lingulist/lingulist.de/).
