title: Blogpost on Monogenesis, Polygenesis, and Militant Agnosticism 
type: news

Whether language originated once or multiple times is an open question
in linguistics. While the question is the topic of multiple discussions,
it is usually ignored in classical historical linguistics, where 
a radical agnosticism is maintained instead. This agnosticism 
is justified, given the large time gap between the time when we assume that
language originated and the time depth we can achieve with our methods for
reconstruction. It has, however, strong implications on our methodology, since
we are always forced to prove that two or more languages are genetically
related before we are allowed to compare them. This is different in biology
where the Tree of Life is taken for granted by most scholars.
I discuss this question in more detail in a blogpost I wrote for David Morrison's blog [The Genealogical World of
Phylogenetic Networks](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.fr/) and which you may
