It was in some sense last minute (but planned as such before) to write my monthly blogpost for David Morrison's blog on [phylogenetic networks](https://phylonetworks.blogspot.com) in the last week of January. This has now been done (also thanks to David's help in making my English and the story in general more readable), and you can find my blogpost on [pronunciation networks in Chinese phonology](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.de/2018/01/networks-of-pronunciation-glosses-in.html) online.
