title: CLICS paper appeared online  
type: news
---

Our paper presenting the CLICSÂ² database of cross-linguistic colexifications has now appeared online officially. Unfortunately, the production team of DeGruyter messed up the online version of the article, so Chinese characters are not readable, and Russian characters are turned upside down. Luckily, the PDF version is correct. The paper is open access and can be accessed [here](https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/lity.2018.22.issue-2/lingty-2018-0010/lingty-2018-0010.xml).
