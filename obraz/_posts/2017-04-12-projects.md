title: New Papers and New Category on Website 
type: news
---

I just wanted to announce two things: with the [EACL](http://eacl2017.org) conference in Valencia this year, two more papers have been added to my website, one on automatic cognate detection (common work with Gerhard JÃ¤ger and Pavel Sofroniev), and one on my [EDICTOR](http://edictor.digling.org). They are now officially linked and can be freely downloaded. 

I also added a new category to my website, namely for research projects, where I will try from now on to list all research projects in which I was involved so far with some minimal amount of information but enough links for interested people to find out more about those respective projects.
