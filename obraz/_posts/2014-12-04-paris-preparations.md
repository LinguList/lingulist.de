title: Last Preparations for Paris 
type: news
---

I am about to move to Paris soon and currently I am trying hard to get the last preparations done. I already found a place to live, but I still have to manage moving out of my apartment in Marburg and getting my stuff to Paris. 
If all works well and according to my expectations, I will be able to start working from January 12 or even earlier.
My future job is a research fellowship awarded by the German Research Foundation for investigating [Vertical and lateral aspects of Chinese dialect history](http://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/261553824?language=en) in cooperation with linguists and biologists from Paris (CRLAO and UPMC).
