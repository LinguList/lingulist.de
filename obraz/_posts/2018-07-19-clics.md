The CLICS database of cross-linguistic colexifications has now officially been
released in a new version, called CLICSÂ², available at
[http://clics.clld.org](http://clics.clld.org). The database features a
multitude of new data points and a completely new framework for data curation
and data analysis. What is new in this new database is also documented in a forthcoming paper, which will soon be published with Linguistic Typology. You can find the draft of that paper [here](http://lingulist.de/documents/papers/list-et-al-2018-clics-draft.pdf).
