This is just to mention two new blog posts I wrote for this month, one in German on 
[politeness](http://wub.hypotheses.org/79), and one for David Morrison's blog on phylogenetic networks, which focuses on the importance of annotation by comparing the impact that annotation systems had on the development of juggling tricks. Here, I use the [siteswap annotation in juggling](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.de/2017/04/the-siteswap-annotation-in-juggling-and.html) to illustrate the power of annotation and modeling, which I think are also a major task for future work in historical linguistics. As always, I do not think we need to replace human experts by big-data engines in our field, but we need to increase the degree of formality by which we present our hypotheses.
