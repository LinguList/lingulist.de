title: Blogpost on the Wave Theory 
type: news
---

The *wave theory* which is usually attributed to Johannes Schmidt ([1872](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Schmidt1872)) is a strange theoretical construct. Traditional linguists and textbooks mention it quite a lot when discussing the danger of tree thinking in historical linguistics. Nevertheless, so far, nobody really could come up with a convincing way to show how one should visualize the wave theory, and how it could be integrated into a historical framework. It seems that the wave theory is in the end nothing than an early attempt of *data-display*, similar to a *data-display network* in the sense of Morrison ([2011](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Morrison2011)). 
 I try to justify this view in a new blogpost which I just wrote for David Morrison's blog on ["The Genealogical World of Phylogenetic Networks](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.de), and which you may find [here](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.de/2015/10/the-wave-theory-predecessor-of-network.html).
