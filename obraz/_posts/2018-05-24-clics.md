We have completely relaunched the database of cross-linguistic colexifications
with help of the CLLD framework, which is now available as a beta-release at
http://clics.clld.org. Our paper (together with Simon Greenhill, Cormac
Anderson, Thomas Mayer, Tiago Tresoldi, and Robert Forkel) introducing the
database, titled "An improved database of cross-linguistic colexifications" is
available in draft form
[here](http://lingulist.de/documents/papers/list-et-al-2018-clics-draft.pdf).
