Today, we released LingPy in version 2.5. It comes along with some really
useful changes, including increased test coverage, full platform support for
Windows, Mac, and Linux, a new algorithm for (preliminary) partial cognate detection, and a command line interface. In addition, documentation has been greatly enhanced, including many software aspects of LingPy which were so far left undocumented.

You can access the documentation at: 

* [http://lingpy.org](http://lingpy.org). 

You can download the source code at:

* [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lingpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lingpy)

And you can contribute, check out our code, and file issues at:

Furthermore, I wrote another blog post for David Morrisons blog [The Genealogical World of Phylogenetic Networks](phylonetworks.blogspot.com), this time on [Machine learning, the Go-game, and language evolution](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.fr/2016/05/machine-learning-go-game-and-language.html).
