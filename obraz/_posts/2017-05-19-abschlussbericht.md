title: Final Report of SinDial Project 
type: news
---

My DFG-funded research project on *Vertical and lateral aspects of Chinese dialect history* officially ended on December 31, 2016. From January 2015 until December 2016 I had two very interesting but also challenging years during which I made acquaintance with many different scholars from different disciplines and countries but also with many new approaches and methods to historical linguistics and related disciplines. 
 
Having submitted my final report in April (first time for a long time I wrote in German again), and hoping that the reviewers do not have anything grave to complain about, I now published the report online with [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org), and you can find it online [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.581413).
