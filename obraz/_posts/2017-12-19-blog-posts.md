type: news

A week earlier than normal, my final blog posts for this year have now appeared, the German one is titled [Die Angst des Jongleurs vorm Fallenlassen](http://wub.hypotheses.org/169) and discusses the problem of letting things go (especially if one tries to juggle). The English one is titled [The art of doing science: alignments in historical linguistics](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.de/2017/12/the-art-of-doing-science-alignments-in.html) and discusses what we should keep in mind when using alignments in historical linguistics.
