title: New German Blog Post on Sound Change
type: news
---

Yesterday, I managed to fulfil my monthly duty of writing the German counterpart to the English blog posts I regularly write.
This time, I write about sound change, and how it can be compared to scenes in comic books. You find the blog post, titled "Plappe Pleiner" [here](http://wub.hypotheses.org/109).
