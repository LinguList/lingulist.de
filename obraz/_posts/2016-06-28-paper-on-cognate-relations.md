title: New Paper on Etymological Word Relations 
type: news
---

A draft of this paper has been on my homepage for some time available for download, but now the paper has also finally been officially published, and I take this as an opportunity to officially announce it here. The paper with the title "Beyond cognacy: historical relations between words and their implication for phylogenetic reconstruction" ([PDF here](http://jole.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/06/28/jole.lzw006.full.pdf), [URL here](http://jole.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/06/28/jole.lzw006)) treats etymological relations between words and somehow summarizes many ideas which I have so far shared both in my earlier [dissertation](http://bibliography.lingpy.org?key=List2014d), but also in quite a few [blogposts](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.fr/search/label/cognacy). In this paper, I further expand the thoughts, and I come to the conclusion that we need multi-state models to handle certain problems of linguistic variation, even when only talking about the dimensions according to which words can vary. Here's the abstract of the paper:

> This article investigates the terminology and the processes underlying the
> fundamental historical relations between words in linguistics (cognacy) and
> genes in biology (homology). The comparison between linguistics and biology
> shows that there are major inconsistencies in the analogies drawn between the
> two research fields and the models applied in phylogenetic reconstruction in
> linguistics. Cognacy between words is treated as a binary relation which is
> either present or not. Words, however, can exhibit different degrees of
> cognacy which go beyond the distinction between orthologous and paralogous
> genes in biology. The complex nature of cognacy has strong implications for
> the models used for phylogenetic reconstruction. Instead of modeling lexical
> evolution as a process of cognate gain and cognate loss, we need to go beyond
> the cognate relation and develop models which take the degrees of cognacy
> into account. This opts for the use of evolutionary models which handle
> multistate characters and allow to define potentially asymmetrical transition
> tendencies among the character states instead of time-reversible binary state
> models in phylogenetic approaches. The benefit of multistate models with
> asymmetric transition tendencies is demonstrated by testing how well
> different models of lexical change perform in semantic reconstruction on a
> lexicostatistical dataset of 23 Chinese dialects in a parsimony framework.
> The results show that the improved models largely outperform the popular
> gainâ€“loss models. This suggests that improved models of lexical change may
> have strong consequences for phylogenetic approaches in linguistics.
