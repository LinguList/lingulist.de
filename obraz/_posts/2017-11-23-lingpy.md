type: news
---

We just released LingPy 2.6, which in addition to some smaller changes that may prove useful was fully concentrated on stabilizing the behavior of the algorithms and making the package easier to use. 

Documentation of the package can be found, as usually, at [http://lingpy.org](http://lingpy.org), and the package itself can be downloaded from the traditional channels, be it [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1065403), [GitHub](https://github.com/lingpy/lingpy), or [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lingpy).
