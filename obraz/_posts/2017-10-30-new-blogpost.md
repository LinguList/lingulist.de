My German blog post for this month is devoted to the case system in Russian, titled [Ein Fall f√ºr Tee](https://wub.hypotheses.org/147). In this post, I discuss how difficult it is in linguistics to identify true regularities without exceptions. 

In addition, my lecture series which I gave at Tianjin university is now available online. You can download the full lecture [here](http://lingulist.de/documents/lectures/list-2017-lecture-ws-calc.pdf).

My monthly post for [The Genealogical World of Phylogenetic Networks](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.de/) will appear tomorrow (31.10.2017). This time, I collaborate with Guido Grimm to investigate cross-linguistic naming patterns for domesticated animals, like *cat*, *dog*, *goat*, and *sheep*.
