title: Inheritance and Cultural Evolution 
type: news
---

It may seem strange but I recently wrote my first book review in my life. With
35 years and almost 8 years as a graduate, I could probably have done a lot
more. The book I reviewed is an anthology devoted to the application of
phylogenetic methods in archaeology, entitled *Cultural Phylogenetics: Concepts
and Applications in Archaeology*, edited by [Larissa Mendoza Straffon
(2016)](http://bibliography.lingpy.org/?key=Straffon2016). I could write more
about the book in this context, but I will just leave it there and instead
recommend those interested in cultural evolution to read the review, which has
been published before print with Systematic Biology, and can be downloaded (in
a preprint version) [from
here](http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/syw085). 

While the review itself serves more as an introduction to the volume, which is
definitely worth reading for those interested in evolution in a broader sense,
a more critical reflection about the problem of *inheritance* in cultural
evolution can be found in recent post I wrote for David Morrison's [Blog on Phylogenetic
Networks](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.fr/), which you [can find here](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.fr/2016/09/inheritance-in-cultural-evolution.html).
