title: New Blog Post on Authority Arguments 
type: news
---

Two days ago, I wrote another blogpost, this time in [Arguments from authority, and the Cladistic Ghost, in historical linguistics](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.de/2017/09/arguments-from-authority-and-cladistic.html). This may look like an offensive argument I make there, but my major intention was to draw the attention to the fact that our "classical" comparative method was never classical in any sense, as it is just a label we use to denote what we do to compare languages, and that, in the light of new approaches, we should not be too dismissive, but rather try to work harder on integrated, computer-assisted frameworks, which will hopefully enable us to understand better, how our languages evolved into their current shape.
