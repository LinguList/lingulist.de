title: Article in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Computational Approaches in Historical Linguistics 
type: news
---

On March 14, an article appeared in the [Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung](https://faz.net), discussing the usefulness and appropriateness of computational approaches in historical linguistics, titled "BÃ¤ume der Erkenntnis", by Wolfgang Krischke. The article also presents our department and mentions our attempts to work on a reconciliation of computational and classical historical linguistics. Unfortunately, I cannot share it at the moment, since it did not appear online, but if it does, we will announce it here.
