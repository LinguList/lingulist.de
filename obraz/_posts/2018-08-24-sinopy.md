title: First official beta release of SinoPy library  
type: news
---

I just submitted a first (beta) version of the SinoPy library for quantitative tasks in Chinese historical linguistics. 
SinoPy is an attempt to provide useful functionality for users working with Chinese dialects and Sino-Tibetan language data and struggling with tasks like converting characters to Pinyin, analysing characters, or analysing readings in Chinese dialects and other SEA languages.

You can find the library on [GitHub](https://github.com/lingpy/sinopy), on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/sinopy), or on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/30593438).
