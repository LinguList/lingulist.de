title: Systemic evolution 
type: news
---

In the very early days of my stay in Paris, my biological host at UPMC, Eric
Bapteste, pointed me to the concept of "systemic evolution" in biology. By then,
I could understand what it meant, more or less, but I had problems in finding to
see its importance for language change. Now, due to recent collaboration with
Nathan Hill on a dataset of Burmish languages, and also thanks to numerous talks
with the biologists in the lab at UPMC, I realized that sound change is best
handled as a linguistic example for systemic evolution, and the fact that some
scholars (like [Trask
2000](http://bibliography.lingpy.org/raw.php?key=Trask2000)) use the term "systematic correspondences" for "regular sound
correspondences" further underlines this (so the idea is not new in linguistics
but has been around for some time). I discuss this in more detail in a recent
blog post I wrote for David Morrison's blog [The Genealogical World of
Phylogenetic Networks](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.fr), which you can find
[here](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.fr/2016/10/sound-change-as-systemic-evolution.html).
