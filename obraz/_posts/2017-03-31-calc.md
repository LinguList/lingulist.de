title: Computer-Assisted Language Comparison 
type: news

It happens that I won an ERC Starting Grant last year, and my research project, titled *Computer-Assisted Language Comparison* will start officially tomorrow. Just in time, I managed to create an initial project-website which will provide more information on what will be going on during the next five years of the project's duration. The website can be found [here](http://calc.digling.org), and you will notice that many of the tools and resources that I offer on this website will be continued to be developed, thanks to the generous funding of the ERC.
