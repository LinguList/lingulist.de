After almost two months of preparation, our [CALC team](http://calc.digling.org) is now busy preparing the first blogposts for our new weblog on [Computer-Assisted Language Comparison in Practice](http://calc.hypotheses.org). 
In the future, we hope to publish minimaly one post per month, targeting different topics, including methodological discussion notes and fresh tutorials on software, data curation, and data analysis.
