I just wrote a new blog post for David Morrison's blog on Phylogenetic Networks, which this time deals with sound change and linguistic reconstruction, arguing that essentially, we do not need any phylogenies (trees rooted networks) to arrive at a reconstruction, at least for the consonants, given the strong nature of directionality in consonant change. This blog post, titled "Trees do not necessarily help in linguistic reconstruction" can be found [here](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.de/2017/06/trees-do-not-necessarily-help-in.html). 

I should also mention that our paper on "Vowel purity and rhyme evidence in Old Chinese reconstruction" (common work with my colleagues from Paris and London, Jananan S. Pathmanathan, Eric Bapteste, Philippe Lopez, and Nathan W. Hill) finally came out today, and you can find the PDF for download [here](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs40655-017-0021-8.pdf).
