title: New LingPy Tutorial Online 
type: news
---

Last week, we had a spring school on Quantitative Methods here in Jena. This is an annual event, and it was the second time that it took place, with Fiona Jordan organizing the main event, and many interesting scientists coming here as tutors or students for one full week (seven days), which was quite exhausting but also very interesting. 
This time, I gave a tutorial on [LingPy](http://lingpy.org), introducing the basic ideas of automatic sequence comparison and how it can be used to get started on computer-assisted work flows. You will find the tutorial online [here](https://github.com/shh-dlce/qmss-2017/blob/master/LingPy/Sequence%20Comparison%20with%20LingPy%20(Johann-Mattis%20List).ipynb) in form of an Ipython Notebook, but you can likewise download the [pdf](http://lingulist.de/documents/tutorials/list-2017-sequence-comparison-lingpy-tutorial.pdf) or follow my introductory [slides](http://lingulist.de/documents/talks/list-2017-lingpy-tutorial.html). All in all, this tutorial will provide you with all the most recent information needed to start making your own analyses with LingPy.
