I just wrote and published a new blog post, this time on "killerarguments" and "proof" in the historical sciences. You find it in an English version in David Morrison's blog on phylogenetic networks under the title ["Killer arguments and the nature of proof in historical sciences"](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.com/2017/05/killer-arguments-and-nature-of-proof-in.html), and you find a German version on my German blog "Von Wörtern und Bäumen" under the title ["Totschlagargumente"](http://wub.hypotheses.org/96).
