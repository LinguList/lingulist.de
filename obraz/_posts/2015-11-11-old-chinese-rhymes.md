title: Rhymes in Old Chinese Poetry 
type: news
---

I mentioned the [application to browse the rhymes in the Shījīng](http://digling.org/shijing/) in the
previous [post](http://lingulist.de/2015/10/27/shijing-browser.html).  In the
meantime, I found time to play around with the rhyme data and to test the
application of network algorithms to analyze Old Chinese rhyme patterns. The
results are quite promising, and you can find more on this topic in the
[slides](https://speakerdeck.com/lingulist/using-network-models-to-analyze-old-chinese-rhyme-data)
of a presentation I gave in London last week (there was a very interesting
two-days workshop on the reconstruction of Old Chinese, hosted by Nathan Hill
from SOAS). I figured that it might likewise be interesting to write about the network analysis of rhyme patterns in more detail on [David Morrison's blog on phylogenetic networks](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.fr/). This new blogpost, titled "Networks in Chinese poetry", is now online and can be found [here](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.fr/2015/11/networks-in-chinese-poetry.html).
