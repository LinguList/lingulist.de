type: news
---

My monthly blogpost in English just appeared online. This time, I am introducing the idea of cross-linguistic colexification networks (as they appear in our [CLICS database](http://clics.lingpy.org)): [Networks of polysemous and homophonous words](http://phylonetworks.blogspot.com/2018/07/networks-of-polysemous-and-homophonous.html).
