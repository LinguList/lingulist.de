title: LingPy Tutorial Accepted 
type: news
---

Our tutorial for the LingPy library, which describes in detail how cognate detection and alignment analyses can be carried out with help of LingPy 2.6, has now finally been accepted for publication with the [Journal of Language Evolution](https://academic.oup.com/jole). This tutorial is supposed to represent the state of the art of what can be done with LingPy and how it should be done. It was prepared in collaboration with Mary Walworth, Simon Greenhill, Tiago Tresoldi, and Robert Forkel, and reflects the strong collaboration between different members of our Department of Linguistic and Cultural Evolution and our CALC research group. The draft of the paper can be found [here](http://lingulist.de/documents/papers/list-et-al-2018-lingpy-tutorial.pdf) and the tutorial itself is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/lingpy/lingpy-tutorial).
