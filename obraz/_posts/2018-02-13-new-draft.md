type: news
---

Yesterday, I finished preparing a paper that will be presented at this year's LFK Young Scholars Symposium in Taipei. It deals with new network approaches to the discipline of Historical Chinese Phonology, including networks of Chinese character formation and networks of Chinese sound glosses. A draft form of the paper can be found [here](http://lingulist.de/documents/papers/list-2018-network-approaches-yinyunxue.pdf).
