Image display in the [Juggling]({{ site.baseurl }}/juggling.html) section is now really easy using the [fancyBox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/) [jQuery](http://jquery.com) plugin. 
 
The plugin even allows to nicely display YouToube videos and slides from Speaker Deck within an iframe, and the tutorial and usage description on the project website is straightforward and easy to comprehend. 
 
This is a very nice tool.
