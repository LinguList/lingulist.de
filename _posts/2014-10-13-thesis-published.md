title: Sequence Comparison in Historical Linguistics 
type: news
---

This is rather old news, not new news, but my thesis has recently been published and can be downloaded from [http://sequencecomparison.github.io](http://sequencecomparison.github.io).

On this website, once can download the full thesis as PDF (published Open Access with the [DÃ¼sseldorf University Press](http://dupress.de)), the source code I created for the analyses in the thesis, and the datasets I compiled to test the new algorithms.
 
The most recent version of all algorithms described in the thesis can be found at [http://github.com/lingpy/lingpy](http://github.com/lingpy/lingpy).
