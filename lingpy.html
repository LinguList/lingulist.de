<h2>LingPy â€” A Python Library for Historical Linguistics</h2>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li> LingPy is a suite of open-source Python modules for sequence comparison, distance analyses, data operations and visualization methods in quantitative historical linguistics.</li>
<li>
The main idea of LingPy is to provide a software package which, on the one hand, integrates different methods for data analysis in quantitative historical linguistics within a single framework, and, on the other hand, serves as an interface for the preparation and analysis of linguistic data using biological software packages.</li>
